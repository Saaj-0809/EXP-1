## AIM: to install Visual Studio Code and writing a program to print hello world, and calculator program

## Theory: VS code is a code editor that, with the appropriate extensions, can run all types of programs and codes. In the codes, MinGW is used to add the c++ extension printing hello world uses the "cout" character output, and the calculator program uses the arithmetic operators sum(+), difference(-), multiplication(*), and division(/).

STEPS TO INSTALL VS CODE NAME: Saaj Mulik PRN: 23070123109 CLASS:EnTC-B(2) 1. Go to the site https://code.visualstudio.com and click on ‘download for windows’. 2. Once the downloading is done, you can view it in the recent download history.
3. Click on the downloaded file to open it. A pop-up window appears, click on ‘I accept the agreement’ and click on next. 4. Select the location where you want to download the file in your computer and click on next.
5. Keep clicking on next and then ‘install’. 6. The installation process will start and we wait till the progress bar reaches its end.
7. Once installed, open the app and go to extensions to download ‘coderunner’. 8. Download a compiler on your pc named ‘MinGW’ from the browser. Go to the link https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/ and click on download.
9. Go to the recent download history tab and click on the setup file for MinGW. A pop-up window appears, click on install. 10. Click on continue and the setup installation will start.
11. Mark all the packages as ‘mark for installation’ and install all the packages. 12. After installing the packages, go to my pc and open the MinGW folder. Open bin and copy the path of the file.
13. Right click on this pc icon and click on properties. Go to ‘advance system settings’ and click on ‘environment variables’. 14. In environment variables, click on path and edit it. Click on new and paste the copied path of MinGW bin.
15. Write a small program of Hello World to check if the program runs or not. EXP 1. Write a C++ program to print Hello World.
EXP 2. Write a C++ program to print the sum of two numbers.
